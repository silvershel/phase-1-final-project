# Yeba Inus
### Author: [silvershel](https://github.com/silvershel)

## Description
An inspirational poster generator using random images of shiba inus (https://shibe.online/) and Kanye West (aka Ye) quotes (https://kanye.rest/).

## Usage
The "Make A Poster" button will generate a poster that combines a random shiba inu image and a random Kanye West quote. If you like the poster that is created you can save it to a gallery. You also clear the posters from the gallery if you change your mind.

### Dark Mode
There is an option to activate dark mode by pressing "d" on your keyboard. When the app is in dark mode it only returns quotes that use a specific obscenity.
